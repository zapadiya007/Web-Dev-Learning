                <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development(Dev) and IT operations(Ops). It aims
                    to shorten
                    the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and provide continuous delivery with high software
                    quality.<sup>[1]</sup> DevOps is complementary to agile software development, several DevOps aspects
                    came from
                    agile way of working.</p>

    <h2 id="Definition">Definition</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for
        "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the
        term "DevOps".<sup>[a][b][c][d]</sup> Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership,
        workflow
        automation, and rapid feedback.
        <br><br>
        From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer science researchers from the
        CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce
        the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while
        ensuring high quality".<sup>[5]</sup>
        <br><br>
        However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific
        practices, culture change, and tools. <sup>[6]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In 1993 the Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture Consortium (TINA-C) defined a Model of a
        Service Lifecycle that combined software development with (telecom) service operations.<sup>[7]</sup>

        In 2009, the first conference named devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian
        consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois.<sup>[8][9]</sup> The conference has now
        spread to other
        countries.<sup>[10]</sup>
        <br><br>
        In 2012, the State of DevOps report was conceived and launched by Alanna Brown at Puppet.<sup>[11][12]</sup>
        <br><br>
        As of 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others.
        They stated that the adoption of DevOps was accelerating.<sup>[13][14]</sup> Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and
        Janet Gregory
        wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps.<sup>[15][16]</sup>
        <br><br>
        In 2016 the DORA metrics for throughput (deployment frequency, lead time for changes), and stability (mean time
        to recover, change failure rate) were published in the State of DevOps report.<sup>[11]</sup>

    <h2 id="Relationship to other approaches">Relationship to other approaches</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Many of the ideas fundamental to DevOps practices are inspired by, or mirror, other well known practices such as
        Lean and Deming's Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, through to The Toyota Way and the Agile approach of breaking down
        components and batch sizes.[17] Contrary to the "top-down" proscriptive approach and rigid framework of ITIL in
        the
        1990s, DevOps is "bottom-up" and a flexible practice, created by software engineers, with software engineer
        needs in
        mind.[18]
        <br><br>
    <h3>Agile</h3>
    <i>Main article: Agile software development</i><br>
    The motivations for what has become modern DevOps and several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and
    test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates (informally) to the
    1990s, and formally to 2001. Agile development teams using methods such as extreme programming couldn't "satisfy the
    customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software"[19] unless they subsumed the operations /
    infrastructure responsibilities associated with their applications, many of which they automated. Because Scrum
    emerged as the dominant Agile framework in the early 2000s and it omitted the engineering practices that were part
    of many Agile teams, the movement to automate operations / infrastructure functions splintered from Agile and
    expanded into what has become modern DevOps. Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software, whether
    it is developed using Agile oriented methodologies or other methodologies.
    <br><br>
    <h3>ArchOps</h3>
    ArchOps presents an extension for DevOps practice, starting from software architecture artifacts, instead of source
    code, for operation deployment.[20] ArchOps states that architectural models are first-class entities in software
    development, deployment, and operations.
    <br><br>
    <h3>CI/CD</h3>
    <i>Main article: CI/CD</i><br>
    Automation is a core principle for achieving DevOps success and CI/CD is a critical component.[21] Plus, improved
    collaboration and communication between and within teams helps achieve faster time to market, with reduced
    risks.[22]
    <br><br>
    <h3>Site-reliability engineering</h3>
    <i>Main article: Site reliability engineering</i><br>
    In 2003, Google developed site reliability engineering (SRE), an approach for releasing new features continuously
    into large-scale high-availability systems while maintaining high-quality end-user experience.[23] While SRE
    predates the development of DevOps, they are generally viewed as being related to each other.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Toyota production system, lean thinking, kaizen</h3>
    <i>Main article: Toyota Production System</i><br>
    Toyota production system, also known under the acronym TPS, was the inspiration for lean thinking with its focus on
    continuous improvement, kaizen, flow and small batches. The andon cord principle to create fast feedback, swarm and
    solve problems stems from TPS.[24][25]
    <br><br>
    <h3>DevSecOps, shifting security left</h3>
    DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach.
    Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct
    security controls into their software delivery. Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the
    development lifecycle, hence the term "shift left" can be used. Security is tested in three main areas: static,
    software composition, and dynamic.
    <br><br>
    Checking the code statically via static application security testing (SAST) is white-box testing with special focus
    on security. Depending on the programming language, different tools are needed to do such static code analysis. The
    software composition is analyzed, especially libraries and their versions are checked against vulnerability lists
    published by CERT and other expert groups. When giving software to clients, licenses and its match to the one of the
    software distributed are in focus, especially copyleft licenses. Dynamic testing is also called black-box testing.
    The software is tested without knowing its inner functions. In DevSecOps it is on one hand called dynamically
    (DAST), or penetration testing. The goal is to catch, amongst others, errors like cross-site scripting, or SQL
    injection early. Threat types are for example published by the open web application security project, e.g. its
    TOP10.[26] On the other hand, especially with microservices interactive application testing (IAST) is helpful to
    check which code is executed when running automated functional tests, the focus is to detect vulnerabilities within
    the applications. Contrary to SAST and DAST, IAST works inside the application.
    <br><br>
    DevSecOps has also been described as a cultural shift involving a holistic approach to producing secure software by
    integrating security education, secure by design, and security automation.[27]</p>

    <h2 id="Cultural change">Cultural change</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>DevOps initiatives can create cultural changes in companies[28] by transforming the way operations, developers,
        and
        testers collaborate during the development and delivery processes.[1] Getting these groups to work cohesively is
        a
        critical challenge in enterprise DevOps adoption.[29][30] DevOps is as much about culture, as it is about the
        toolchain.[31]
        <br><br>
    <h3>Microservices</h3>
    Although in principle it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style, the microservices
    architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems. Small size service allows
    the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring.[32]
    <br><br>
    <h3>DevOps automation</h3>
    It also supports consistency, reliability, and efficiency within the organization, and is usually enabled by a
    shared code repository or version control. As DevOps researcher Ravi Teja Yarlagadda hypothesizes, "Through DevOps,
    there is an assumption that all functions can be carried out, controlled, and managed in a central place using a
    simple code."[33]
    <br><br>
    <h3>Automation with version control</h3>
    Many organizations use version control to power DevOps automation technologies like virtual machines,
    containerization (or OS-level virtualization), and CI/CD. The paper "DevOps: development of a toolchain in the
    banking domain" notes that with teams of developers working on the same project, "All developers need to make
    changes to the same codebase and sometimes edit even the same files. For efficient working, there has to be a system
    that helps engineers avoid conflicts and retain the codebase history,"[34] with the Git version control system and
    the GitHub platform referenced as examples.</p>
