                    The <b>Arduino Uno</b> is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P
                    microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc and initially released in 2010. <sup>[2][3]</sup>The
                    board is
                    equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various
                    expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. <sup>[1]</sup> The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six
                    capable of
                    PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development
                    Environment), via a type B USB cable.<sup>[4]</sup> It can be powered by the USB cable or by an
                    external 9-volt
                    battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and
                    Leonardo.<sup>[5][6]</sup> The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons
                    Attribution
                    Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for
                    some versions of the hardware are also available.

                    The word "uno" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark the initial release of Arduino
                    Software.<sup>[1] </sup>The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino
                    boards;<sup>[3]</sup> it and version
                    1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer
                    releases.<sup>[4] </sup>The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows
                    uploading
                    new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer.<sup>[3]</sup>

                    While the Uno communicates using the original STK500 protocol,<sup>[1] </sup>it differs from all
                    preceding
                    boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it uses the Atmega16U2
                    (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>The Arduino project started at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy. At that
                time, the students used a BASIC Stamp microcontroller, at a cost that was a considerable expense for
                many students. In 2003, Hernando Barragán created the development platform Wiring as a Master's thesis
                project at IDII, under the supervision of Massimo Banzi and Casey Reas, who are known for work on the
                Processing language. The project goal was to create simple, low-cost tools for creating digital projects
                by non-engineers. The Wiring platform consisted of a printed circuit board (PCB) with an ATmega168
                microcontroller, an IDE based on Processing, and library functions to easily program the
                microcontroller.<sup>[8]</sup>In 2003, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis, another IDII student, and David
                Cuartielles, added support for the cheaper ATmega8 microcontroller to Wiring. But instead of continuing
                the work on Wiring, they forked the project and renamed it Arduino. Early arduino boards used the FTDI
                USB-to-serial driver chip and an ATmega168.<sup>[8]</sup> The Uno differed from all preceding boards by
                featuring
                the ATmega328P microcontroller and an ATmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a
                USB-to-serial converter.</td>

    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>The Arduino/Genuino Uno has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino/Genuino
        board, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328 provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available
        on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and
        appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The 16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers,
        and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required. Arduino Software (IDE) includes
        a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX LEDs on the
        board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer
        (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A SoftwareSerial library allows serial communication on any
        of the Uno's digital pins.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

    <h3>Automatic (software) reset</h3>
    <p> Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Arduino/Genuino Uno board is
        designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. One of the hardware
        flow control lines (DTR) of the ATmega8U2/16U2 is connected to the reset line of the ATmega328 via a 100
        nanofarad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the
        chip.<sup>[7]</sup>

        This setup has other implications. When the Uno is connected to a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets
        each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half-second or so, the
        bootloader is running on the Uno. While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an
        upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is
        opened. <sup>[7]</sup> </p>
